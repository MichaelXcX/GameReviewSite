        title='Elden Ring hero Let Me Solo Her says Shadow of the Erdtree isn`t too hard, "many people are just too harsh" and should "use everything at their disposal"'

        text='Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree reignited debate around the ideal level of challenge not just in 
        FromSoftware games but in games in general, with some arguing that the DLC throws out needless difficulty spikes 
        and leaving negative reviews on Steam. FromSoftware has since made the expansion a bit easier by buffing early 
        Scadutree levels (and outright pleading with players to take advantage of them). Tarnished hero Let Me Solo Her, 
        famous for helping thousands beat the toughest boss in the base game, Malenia, reckons some people are just 
        overreacting and should probably expand their tactics. In an interview with GamesRadar+, Let Me Solo Her agrees 
        that Shadow of the Erdtree is, generally, the biggest challenge Elden Ring has to offer. "The DLC bosses so far 
        have been a test of true skill in my opinion and players need to learn patience and timings for counterattacks," 
        the jar-headed warrior says. But looking at the sheer difficulty of individual DLC bosses, he`d generally rate 
        them below Malenia, an optional boss notorious for unforgiving attack animations, two exhausting phases, and a 
        life-sapping mechanic that counters many strategies. Let Me Solo Her says he`s been enjoying Shadow of the Erdtree 
        "a lot," stopping to drink in the scenery between epic bosses. "I haven’t beaten it yet, but I’m at the last boss 
        right now and I think it will take some time before I beat him. I took some time to master Messmer but I think I 
        ran pretty straightforward for the DLC," he says, right on the heels of the reveal of Let Me Solo Him, his new 
        Messmer-destroying character. If any DLC boss can measure up to Malenia, he says, it would be the final boss. '

        title='Bounty Star feels like Armored Core in the Wild West, and while the combat`s great it`s the Monster Hunter and Stardew Valley vibes that really grabbed me'
        author="Dustin Bailey"

        text='When I sat down to play Bounty Star during Summer Game Fest, I was sold the instant I realized this was a 
        Wild West-themed mech game with big Cowboy Bebop energy all about a very sad old bounty hunter named Clem. I`m not 
        sure I`ve ever seen a collection of vibes so laser-targeted toward me, specifically, and luckily the actual gameplay
         feels like a genre blend just as compelling. The action in Bounty Star takes place across a series of missions 
         with specific maps and enemy layouts. The stage I played was pretty open-ended, offering a variety of ways to 
         approach your targets - important, since just sprinting straight in will quickly leave you surrounded by more bad 
         guys than you can deal with, especially once you factor in the patrolling enemies that might wander in to give you 
         a bad day. Combat is nice and weighty, and while it might be a cliché to say it reminded me of Dark Souls, 
         FromSoftware`s own Armored Core makes a nice comparison point. You have to commit to your melee attacks, at least 
         if you`re using the default sword, but it`s very satisfying once it lands. Your loadout seems to matter in a big 
         way, too - I really struggled to complete the opening mission until I swapped out the sword for a much faster 
         punching weapon and paired it with a big ol` grenade launcher that just melted enemy health bars.But as much as 
         I enjoyed the combat, it`s the downtime between missions that really has me intrigued. You explore a hub that 
         includes the garage where Clem works on her mech and a bit of outlying land where you can grow and pick 
         ingredients, Stardew Valley-style. You can then put these ingredients into a meal that`ll buff you for the 
         mission ahead, just like cooking something up in Monster Hunter. The game`s Steam page also notes that there are 
         "base building" mechanics, so it seems there`s plenty more depth to be found here. I only got to play about 30 
         minutes of Bounty Star, but impeccable vibes spread over great combat and an intriguing meta-progression system 
         instantly had me hooked. It`s rocketed up my wishlist, and I`m very much looking forward to seeing how the final 
         game comes together when it launches across Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, and PC later this year. '

        title='Starfield`s Premium Edition gets discounted to $70, which basically makes the Shattered Space DLC free before it even launches'
        author="Jordan Gerblick"
        date="June 29, 2024"
        text='The Premium Edition of Starfield has been given a 30% discount on Steam, dropping the price to $69.99, 
        the same price as the base game at launch. The deal is good until July 11. Although it`s admittedly a slightly 
        cynical take, it`s also quite true that this Starfield Premium Edition discount essentially makes the 
        to-be-released Shattered Space DLC, which is included in the package, free, since you`d pay the same price at 
        retail for the standard edition of the game that doesn`t include the expansion. Granted, I`m not seeing this 
        discount anywhere except Steam, so this need not apply if you`re playing on console or the Xbox PC launcher.A less
         cynical way to put this is: this is a really good deal if you don`t already own Starfield and don`t have a 
         subscription to Game Pass where it`s available free to subscribers. Despite the lukewarm reception relative to 
         other mainline Bethesda launches, there`s a fair bit of hype around Shattered Space, so it`s not a bad time to 
         hop aboard if you`ve been on the fence. Director Todd Howard recently shared his insight into the scope of the 
         Shattered Space DLC and what players can expect from the new content, and he directly compared it to Fallout 4`s 
         Far Harbor expansion. Because "the bulk" of the DLC will take place within an entirely new area built just for the
          DLC, Bethesda has been afforded the opportunity to take a more traditional approach to environment crafting. "It
           allows us to build a landscape like we would traditionally do, and have the city and the quest," he said. "And 
           so, that story takes place there, and the landscape`s kind of… content-wise we`re looking at kind of like what
         we did with Far Harbor on Fallout 4, where like, okay, this is a scope that works for our development in doing 
         this kind of annual story expansion type of thing."

Shattered Space is due out sometime this year. '
